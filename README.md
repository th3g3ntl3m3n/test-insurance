## thoughts on this test project
As with the requirements I needed to create a insurance flow for test. I am experience in ReactJS and other technologies.
This only require to build the form frontend so I created a 2 pages UI for the same.

Page 1 is be for Introduction 
page 2 is for insurance form submission
